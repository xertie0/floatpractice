    <h1>
        Donna Paulsen
    </h1>
    <p>
        Donna Roberta Paulsen, played by Sarah Rafferty, is Harvey Specter's legal secretary, 
        close friend, and confidant. She has worked with him since his first year as an 
        Assistant District Attorney, and she left the DA's office with him to work with him 
        at Pearson Hardman. She listens in on all the conversations in his office, partially 
        because he never turns the intercom off. She knows the private details of his personal 
        life and relationships. She is also an integral part of Harvey's pre-trial ritual. 
    <p>
        Donna, like Harvey, is brashly confident and self-assured, but unlike Harvey, she 
        is able to understand her own feelings well and intuitively understand the feelings 
        of others around her and how those people's feelings are reflected through their 
        corresponding actions. She often explains Harvey's feelings to him when he is on 
        the verge of making a gut decision with significant potential for future repercussions 
        for him or his relationships with his clients or co-workers. 
        She often also takes pride at knowing things before Harvey asks for them, 
        and is usually able to out-think everyone, except for Harvey, who is usually 
        able to quickly discern when Donna has an ulterior motive and makes a point of 
        calling her out on it, despite her efforts to prevent him from doing so.

    <p>
       Donna is considered the best legal secretary in New York City, and she carries 
       enough power in the firm to intimidate senior partner Louis Litt, especially 
       since she remembers most of Louis's indiscretions. Mike Ross often comes to 
       her when he thinks he needs help, and she mocks him because he does not really 
       need help; when Mike actually needs help, she provides all the assistance she can. 
       She often jokes that she knows everything, and she is witty and has a sardonic 
       sense of humor. Whenever she solves a seemingly impossible problem for Harvey, 
       Louis or Mike, they inevitably ask how she did it and she often gives the simple 
       response, "I'm Donna."
